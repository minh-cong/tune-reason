# Fine-Tuning Language Models for Enhanced Reasoning

This repository provides tools to generate reasoning datasets, fine-tune language models (e.g., Phi-3), and perform inference. Designed for researchers and developers exploring LLM reasoning capabilities.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Before you begin:
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended)
- Hugging Face libraries (`transformers`, `datasets`)
